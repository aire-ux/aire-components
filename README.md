# Aire-UX

Welcome to Aire-UX!  Aire-UX is a set of components and libraries for
developing, testing, and theming [WebComponent](https://www.webcomponents.org/)-based widgets.  Aire-UX provides native
integration with [Vaadin Flow](https://vaadin.com/flow); we hope to support [Vaadin Fusion](https://vaadin.com/fusion) in the future.


## Overview
Aire-UX provides 90+ WebComponent-based widgets including charts, wizards,
docking, docking, themeing, and more. Aire-UX integrates natively with Sunshower.io's [Zephyr project](https://zephyr.sunshower.io)
to provide native SPA extensibility.


### Status
All of the components are currently used in production at Sunshower.io with
the exception of the themeing system; however, they were built for our purposes and much work remains
to be done before they're integrated with our themeing system released for general consumption. We'll work
to provide a comprehensive list of available components, but we're happy to prioritize components upon
request.


### Aire CSS Selectors

One unique feature of using Aire-UX's infrastructure with Vaadin Flow is the
ability to set up representative in-memory Vaadin contexts 
(via the excellent [Karibu mocking framework](https://github.com/mvysny/karibu-testing) browserless testing framework) 
and inject live elements via full-featured CSS selectors L3 (L4 mostly supported--enhancements will be considered upon request)


## Getting Started

We're working on publishing high-quality and exhaustively-tested libraries, but until we formally release
all components and software should be considered to be alpha quality.
